Web Analyzer API (Go)

Pre requirements
1. Install Docker Desktop
2. Install Golang 1.24 version

# Challenges
1. As I am new to golang, initially implemented single page. Then had to refer lot of videos articles to understand how to use middleware, pointers and refactoring techniques.
2. Difficult to identify the requested informations like spefic kind of links then refered similar logic through intenet and customised as required
3. Even created the docker image, it was not running properly and got help from internet to do some customizations.

# Possible Improvements
 1. Analyzed responses can be saved in a database and then existing responses can be retrieved without doing analysis again.
 2. Authentication can be applied to avoid accessing unknown users.
 3. Parallel processing can be applied for treating multiple requests using WaitGroup.
